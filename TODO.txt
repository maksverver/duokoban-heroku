 - level list:
    sorting?
    creation/modification times?
 - style frontpage
 - favicon?

voting:
 - widget could look a little nicer (mouse-over?)
 - maybe track votes in a cookie/local storage?

client:
 - clean up control-related code at some point!

server:
 - support storing trace of solution (and at some point, check it!)
 - maybe: internet multiplayer?

editor:
 - should refresh level list after submission
 - should allow deleting of levels
 - make tools work more uniformly
 - allow adding/removing arbitrary borders (instead of just reframing)
 - allow selecting/moving parts of the level
