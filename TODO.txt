 - chrome bug circle rendering
 - controls: should continue pushing if key is held down and player is temporarily blocked
 - add more default levels!
 - easier way to share levels?
 - maybe: internet multiplayer?
 - remove all the grab-related nonsense if the current controls suffice
 - allow submitting levels
